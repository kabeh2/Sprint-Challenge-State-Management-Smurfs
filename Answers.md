1. What problem does the context API help solve?
   The Context API solves the problem of 'prop drilling'. Essentially without a state management setup like redux or context, if you wanted to pass state through to a child component 3 tiers down, you would have to pass it into it's parent components whether they need them or not.

1. In your own words, describe `actions`, `reducers` and the `store` and their role in Redux. What does each piece do? Why is the store known as a 'single source of truth' in a redux application?

1) What is the difference between Application state and Component state? When would be a good time to use one over the other?
1) Describe `redux-thunk`, what does it allow us to do? How does it change our `action-creators`?
1) What is your favorite state management system you've learned and this sprint? Please explain why!
